Home Products Product Catalog Global Skills Assessment Description The Global Skills Assessment (GSA) is an assessment used to measure 96 discrete skills/behaviors. These 96 skill scores are directly aligned to the most discrete level of SHL’s Universal Competency Framework (UCF). The GSA measures self-reported behaviors an individual currently engages in. A person’s skills (sets of behavior) are malleable and may change over time. SHL utilizes GSA scores to understand what the participant reports they can do today.
